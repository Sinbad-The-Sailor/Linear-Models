# Linear-Models

#### 1. Exponential Regression

Modelling bacteria using exponential regression. This is done by transforming the exponential data into linear data using $\ln(\cdot)$, after which regular linear regression techniques can be used. Regressing based on temperature and humidity a $R^2 = 78 \%$ is obtained. An important task of regression is to check the validity of the linear regression assumptions pertaining to the residuals. 

* Residulas have constant variance
* Residulas are independent
* Resiudals are normally distributed

The residual analysis was performed with graphical methods, although, more sophisticated statistical tests for normality and correlation could be useful.

Next, confidence and prediction bands were calculated for the regression model as shown below. The confidence interval gives a range of possible models, $\mathbb{E}[Y]$, that could be fit depending on the sample of the population. The prediction interval gives a range of possible values for a new observation $Y$. Note the difference between the two.
